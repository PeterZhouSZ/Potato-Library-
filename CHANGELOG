--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.3.1

- Core
    # few issues with cuda have been updated

- Exemple
    # SSC gls examples updated


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.3

- Documentation
    # New version with improved presentation, new examples, user manual, images, references, etc.
    # Examples fixed.
    # We now have a logo !

- Tests
    # Now using ctest for the unit tests
    # Few functional tests have been added

- Core
    # Fits now have a state. The finalize() function can return it. See doc for more details.
    # Fit degenerative cases are now well treated (for example plane case). Thus, it should no more produce QNaN values.
    # Library cleaned of useless code / files.
    # Code refactoring, we now follow some guidelines (see guidelines.txt).


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
V0.1.2

 - BugFix
   # Fix space derivatives equals to NaN when the local query is (0,...,0)
   
 - Documentation
   # Update documentation on partial support of SelfAdjointEigenSolver in cuda
   # Update documentation on GLSCurvatureHelper: new tutorial
   
 - Functionalities
   # Add a ready state in algebraic sphere that is set to true by the fitting kernels finalize method
   # Add method to compare two GLS instances
   # Add helper class to compute principal curvatures
   
 - Improvements
   # Use optimized storage order for derivatives vectors wrt space/space differentiation parameters
   
 - Tests
   # Add eigendecomposition test
   
 - Cleaning
   # Remove unused include directives
