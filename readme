1. Using the Patate library
***************************

There is no need to compile this library to use it. Simply add the Patate/ directory to your include path.
The only required dependency is on the Eigen library for linear algebra, vectors and matrices purposes.
A significant portion of the library is also CUDA-compatible, please refer to the documentation for details.

The Patate library is divided into modules (a.k.a. "patates"), and you may include each of them separately.
The best way to find out how to use a module is to start from tutorials provided in the documentation.
Various examples are also documented and their source code provided in the examples/ directory.

Further sections explain how to build the documentation and compile the examples.
An online version of the documentation for the last release is also available at
  http://patate.gforge.inria.fr/html/
For more information


2. Building the documentation
*****************************

Starting from the root directory, first create a build/ directory and launch CMake from it:
  mkdir build && cd build && cmake ..

To generate the documentation using Doxygen, use the following command from the build/ directory:
  make doc

The up-to-date documentation will then be found in the doc/html/ directory.



3. Compiling the examples
*************************

Make sure the EIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR environment variable is set to your Eigen path.
Re-launch CMake every time this variable is modified.

To compile examples, use the following command from the build/ directory:
  make examples

The example binaries will then be found in the build/examples/ directory.

If you want to compile examples of a single module, you can use the targets <module>_examples:
  make grenaille_examples
